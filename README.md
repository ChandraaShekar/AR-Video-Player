# AR Video Player



I have used Python and OpenCV to create an AR based Video Player.


My main intention was to write a program that would recognise an image from the webcam and play a relevant video in the place of the image.


Right now the program is able to detect an image from the webcam and play the relevant video in the place of the image.


## Problem: 

The frame rate of the video being played is very less. It looks like a slow motion video.


## TO DO: 

1. Check if the image is existing in the database

2. Select and Play the relevant video to the image.

3. Optimize the loop to run faster to increase the frame rate of the video.
