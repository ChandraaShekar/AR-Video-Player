# AR Video Player



I have used Python and OpenCV to create an AR based Video Player.


I have created a program that would recognise an image from the webcam and play a relevant video in the place of the image.


## Problem: 

The frame rate of the video being played is very less. It looks like a slow motion video.


## TO DO: 
1. Optimize the loop to run faster to increase the frame rate of the video.
